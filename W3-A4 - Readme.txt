This project implements an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) solution in Python for managing a simplified college database using the sqlite3 library. The system models three core entities—Course, Teacher, and Student—along with two linking tables, Designate and Enrollment (represented as the Assign table in the code), detailing the relationships as specified in the conceptual design.

The database is populated with sample data and the project executes specific queries to retrieve key statistics: it calculates and displays the total number of students enrolled in the 'MSE800' course, and it lists the names and details of all teachers designated to teach the 'MSE801' course. The entire codebase includes inline comments to explain the purpose of each class, method, and major block of code, thus adhering to the project's documentation standards.
